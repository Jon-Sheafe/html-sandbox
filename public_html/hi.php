					How long can two people talk about nothing? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I'll be sure to note that in my log. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.
